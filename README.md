# ðŸš€ My Kotlin Algorithm and LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my learning process and progress as I focus on mastering **Kotlin** and tackling **LeetCode** problems. ðŸ’»

## ðŸŒŸ Why I'm Doing This

As a developer, I believe that understanding algorithms and data structures is key to becoming proficient at solving complex problems. By working through these challenges, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and overall coding efficiency in Kotlin.

## ðŸ”¥ Current Focus

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** using **Kotlin**
- Practicing **LeetCode** problems regularly
- Implementing brute-force approaches and optimizing over time
- Strengthening my understanding of time and space complexities
